There's always another one isn't there? Another bug, another feature, always something over
the horizon that needs to be fixed or built. The moment there isn't your project is effectively
dead. That's just the way it works. 

That's where the idea for this site came from. Well, the name of it anyway. We'll just have to 
see where that takes it.

One warning, most of the content on this site is written in a "stream of consciousness" still
with minimal reworking or editing. That's primarily because I don't presently have an editor
and try to spend more time doing other things than writing them up. Still, if you find something
particularly egregious, there is that nice little link in the upper right hand corner of the
site that will take you to the Github project for the Hugo sources. Feel free to send me a
pull request with any updates you feel are warranted!
