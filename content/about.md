There's always another one isn't there? Another bug, another feature, always something over
the horizon that needs to be fixed or built. The moment there isn't your project is effectively
dead. That's just the way it works. 

That's where the idea for this site came from. Well, the name of it anyway. We'll just have to 
see where that takes it.
